Stone Chests for Minecraft 1.7


This mod adds two chests to minecraft. 

Firstly a basic stone chest just requiring Cobblestone & (Smooth) Stone. This is the same size as a normal wooden chest, though the chest cannot be turned into a double chest.

The second chest is a reinforced stone chest, which requires reinforced stone. This is the same size as an iron chest and is also highly resistant to explosions.
