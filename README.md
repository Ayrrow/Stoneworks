Stoneworks for Minecraft (currently 1.7.10)

WORK IN PROGRESS

Heavily based off Pahimar's Let's Mod Reboot (github.com/pahimar & youtube.com/pahimar)

This mod adds a collection of items that mimic their vanilla wooden counterparts, as well as a couple of useful blocks and items build from stone.

The objective of this mod is to provide an alternative to trees in the early game allowing custom worlds that lack trees, or giving the player a different set of options in a normal world.

<h1> Work-In-Progress Blocks/Items. </h1>

<h4> Planned for version 1.0 </h4>


* Reinforced Stone - *Is a blast resistant (near Obsidian) building block that is used in a variety of recipes and items. Includes Bricks and other variants. Decorate all the things!*

* Reinforced Stone Tools - *Exactly the same as Iron Tools, except cheaper. Crafted with reinforced rods and stone*

* Reinforced rod - *In Rod We Trust (same way as sticks, 8 rods per 2 reinforced stone).*

* Stone Crafting Table - *A crafting table that is blast resistant and holds items in the crafting grid.*

* Delver's Workbench - *Highly blast resistant crafting bench/chest combo like Project Benches from Redpower 2.*

* Crafting Tablet - *Portable crafting table.*

* Reinforced Stone Crafting Table - *Such durability, much blast resistance.*

* Stone Chest - *Slightly smaller, but cheaper and easier to craft chest. Requires 5 cobble and 3 (smooth) stone.*

* Reinforced Stone Chest - *Large size chest, almost impervious to explosions, can be locked. 8 reinforced stone.*

<h1> Future Plans. </h1>

* Delver's Helmet - *Iron Helmet with a light source; requires Paraffin Oil.*

* Crusher - *Standard 2x Ore processing. This one will however be cheap, slow, available really early game and require some space.*


* Reinforced Furnace - *2 input slots, 2 output slots, can accept certain liquids as fuel. Slightly faster than a regular furnace.* *In the far future, implementation of side configuration tab ala Thermal Expansion.*

* Retort - *For turning Coal into Paraffin Oil.*

* Oil Lamps - *More decorations! No seriously, I'd kill for a few decent decorative light blocks. This will be my attempt. These will require Paraffin Oil - but will last ages.*

* Paraffin Oil - *The first step of producing fuel from coal, will be used in the Delver's Helmet and Oil Lamps. Will not be the same as Buildcraft Oil.*

* Refinery - *Further distilling Paraffin to Synthetic Fuel.*

* Synthetic Fuel - *An extra level of refinement to the Paraffin Oil, makes it a much better fuel source but cannot be used in Delver's Helmet or Oil Lamps. Will probably be Ore Dict'd with Buildcraft Fuel.*


<h1> Other Things </h1>

* Redstone Flux [RF] support, including a generator (burning Paraffin Oil & Synthetic Fuel) (or two) and eventually machines.

* FMP support for Reinforced Stone.
