Stoneworks for Minecraft 1.7.10

This mod adds a collection of items that mimic their vanilla wooden counterparts, as well as a couple of useful blocks and items build from stone.

The objective of this mod is to provide an alternative to trees in the early game allowing custom worlds that lack trees, or giving the player a different set of options in a normal world.

<h1> WIP Blocks/Items. </h1>

* Reinforced Stone - Is a blast resistant (near obisidian) building block that is used in a variety of recipes and items.[]

Crafted with 5 smooth stone and 4 iron bars; giving 8 reinforced stone.
    -> Bricks and other variants. - Decorate all the things.

* Reinforced Stone Tools - Exactly the same as Iron Tools, except cheaper. Crafted with reinforced rods and stone

* Reinforced rod - In Rod We Trust (same way as sticks, 8 rods per 2 reinforced stone).

* Stone Crafting Table - a crafting table that is blast resistant and holds items in the crafting grid.

* Delver's Workbench - highly blast resistant crafting bench/chest combo like Project Benches.

* Crafting Tablet - portable crafting table.

* Reinforced Stone Crafting Table - such durability, much blast resistance.

* Stone Chest - Slightly smaller, but cheaper and easier to craft chest. Requires 5 cobble and 3 (smooth) stone.

* Reinforced Stone Chest - Large size chest, almost impervious to explosions, can be locked. 8 reinforced stone.



<h1> Other Things </h1>

* Redstone Flux [RF] support, including a generator (or two) and eventually machines.

* FMP support for Reinforced Stone.



<h1> Future Plans. </h1>

* Delver's Helmet - Iron Helmet with a light source; requires fuel.

* Crusher - Standard 2x Ore processing. This one will however be cheap, slow, available really early game and require some space.


* Reinforced Furnace - 2 input slots, 2 output slots, can accept lava as fuel. Slightly faster than a regular furnace.

* Parrafin Oil - The First step of producing fuel from coal, will be used in the Delver's Helmet.

* Synthetic Fuel - Fischerâ€“Tropsch process from Coal - this will involve a multiblock of somesort.
